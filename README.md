# 💻 Computer Science Portfolio  

Welcome to my **Computer Science Portfolio**, a collection of projects demonstrating my skills in software development, algorithms, data science, and web development. This repository serves as a central hub to showcase my work to potential employers.

## 📂 Projects Overview  

Below is a curated list of projects, with links to their respective repositories and highlights of the technologies used.  

### 🔹 [C# To Do List](https://github.com/titansrule3035/CSharpToDoList/tree/0907a9f26a461fba992c2ea96a643cb0f1c2e1f1)  

**Description:** A simple C# "To-Do List" console application that stores data into a text file.  
**Technologies:** C# .NET Framework, Microsoft Cryptography  
**Highlights:** Filestream and cryptography, the save file is obfuscated and then encrypted to prevent outside sources from reading/writing to sensitive data.  

### 🔹 [C# Calculator UI](https://github.com/titansrule3035/CSharpCalculatorUI/tree/e9f915962b7fa4dba5092158bfa4ccb042a7ff7a)  

**Description:** A WinForms-based calculator application that supports full expression evaluation and floating-point numbers.  
**Technologies:** C# .NET Framework, WinForms  
**Highlights:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimal numbers, and full expression parsing with operator precedence, using **a custom, in-house, algebraic expression parser**. The UI includes a fixed-size window and an intuitive button layout.  

### 🔹 [Unity C# Inventory System Demo](https://github.com/titansrule3035/unity-c-sharp-inventory-system-test/tree/f1ee7239c24768bdc3e64a40f0ce5db88d826c52)

**Description:** A demo "game" project in Unity showcasing a complete inventory system, dialogue system, debug system, and their interactions within a closed space.  
**Technologies:** C#, .NET Framework, Unity Engine, INK API  
**Highlights:** Easy-to-use inventory system with grab-and-drop based item functionality, item stacking, and item usage. The dialogue system is powered by the INK API, allowing for branching narratives and player choices. The debug system provides real-time feedback on game state and player actions.

You can also find many other, smaller projects in the projects folder of this repo. These are things that still demonstrate my skills in everyday Computer Science, but are a bit too niche to highlight.
